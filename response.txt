================================== Ai Message ==================================

Recent notices regarding 'corrosion-resistant steel' were published by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the International Trade Commission. The Commerce Department amended its preliminary determination related to certain corrosion-resistant steel products from the Republic of Türkiye due to a significant ministerial error, while the International Trade Commission scheduled the final phase of countervailing duty and antidumping investigations for corrosion-resistant steel products from multiple countries to determine potential material injury to U.S. industries.

The Securities and Exchange Commission published notices related to proposed rule changes about a participant system disruption by entities like The Depository Trust Company, Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, and National Securities Clearing Corporation, as well as a fee schedule update by Cboe EDGX Exchange, Inc. to provide discounts on fees to qualifying academic purchasers for certain reports.
